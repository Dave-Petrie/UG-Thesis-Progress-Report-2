  Dear Professor Walker,
\end{flushleft}

In accordance with the requirements of the degree of Bachelor of
Engineering / Bachelor of Finance (IX28) in the division of Computer Systems
Engineering / Electrical and Electronic Engineering, I present the
following thesis entitled Feasibility Study of Low Voltage Direct Current Power Distribution.  This work was performed under the supervision of Associate Professor Geoffrey Walker.

I declare that the work submitted in this thesis is my own, except as
acknowledged in the text with references, and has not been previously
submitted for a degree at Queensland University of Technology or any other
institution.

\begin{flushright}
	Yours sincerely,\\

\section*{Abstract}

\paragraph{}
This design project aims to explore the issue of incorporating low or extra low voltage direct current (DC) power distribution systems to multi-residential and commercial buildings. Low voltage DC power is prevalent in telecommunications systems but has the possibility of being used for a variety of other applications to reduce electricity costs and improve efficiency. Due to the large costs involved in building power systems, the majority of this design project will be completed through software simulations and hand calculations. If these methods cannot be utilised, either physical testing or research will be completed as substitute. If successful, a more efficient and cheaper alternative to running simple electronics from Alternating Current (AC) mains will be created. This will allow for a portion of building's electricity demands to be self sufficient and not rely on the grid for continual supply. 

\paragraph{}
To complete this task, the project was separated into individual questions that are interrelated and help to conclude whether the project will be successful or not. These questions will cover finer details of the project including the chosen DC voltage level, whether photovoltatics can be used, if lighting requirements will be met, structural design and safety mechanisms for voltage loss reduction and finally whether DC could reasonably replace AC for portions of commercial building power systems. Simulations were completed using System Advisor Model (SAM) for photovoltaics, Dialux4.12 for lighting, AutoCad for structural layouts and Microsoft Excel for all calculations and efficiency modelling.
