\subsection{Project Test Model}

\paragraph{}
This section outlines the test model that was created after the draft model stage, QUT data access and initial photovoltaic systems analysis. In order to create the test model of a ``real-world" Brisbane based commercial building to structure the analysis around, the QUT schematics and personal experience within Brisbane's built environment were integral. 

\subsubsection{Lighting Loads}

\paragraph{}
To calculate approximate lighting loads to be expected for a floor, level 6 of QUT P Block was marked up to count the number of luminaires installed. A full floor plan is shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:qut_lvl6_markup} but an image export is below in Figure \ref{fig:qut-lvl6-lighting-markup}.

Table \ref{table:QUTlvl6-count} below outlines the counts from the markup.
