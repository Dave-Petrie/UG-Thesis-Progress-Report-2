\section{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}
The project being undertaken plans to design and confirm the feasibility of a DC power distribution for commercial buildings to power low load electronics such as lighting and simple devices with an array of photo-voltaic cells. The completion of this task will require extensive research, time, calculations and computer simulations. Milestones that have been set meet the SMART criteria which will allow for tracking and maintaining progress throughout the project. A literature review and analysis of the task has been completed. Additionally, through testing and simulations initial calculations and test modelling have been completed. 

\paragraph{}
As of the submission of this progress report (April 2017) calculations have been completed and some conclusions made. The remaining tasks are

***TO BE COMPLETED***

\paragraph{}
Thus far, 48\,V\,DC has been deemed the most appropriate voltage level for the system and remaining calculations based off that value.

\paragraph{}
The project being undertaken plans to design and confirm the feasibility of a DC power distribution for commercial buildings to power low load electronics such as lighting and simple devices with a group of photo-voltaic cells. The completion of this task will require extensive research, time, calculations and computer simulations. Milestones that have been set meet the SMART criteria which will allow for tracking and maintaining progress throughout the project. The initial research phase has been completed and designs have begun initial stages.

\paragraph{}
Computer simulations are the main design solution due to the large costs involved in commercial power system implementation. By simulating designs and providing visual aids through 3D rendered images, the presentation will be show not only calculation data but designs implemented on a visual model. In the event that an experimental test can be financially and physically completed and it would benefit the task, it will be done.    

\paragraph{}
Overall it is expected that this research project will be completed with a feasible design. If it is found that no solution will be suitable, a strong justification and possible future areas of discussion will be brought forward. January 2017 will have a complete preliminary design along with justification for the feasibility so that a presentation can be made and successful progress shown. By ensuring that this stage is reached, valuable feedback will be provided via the project supervisor and academic team behind the course.
