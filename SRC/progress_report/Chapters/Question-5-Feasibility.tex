\subsection{Is DC a Feasible Alternative to AC in Commercial Lighting Systems?}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\paragraph{}
This is the overall question of the project. In conjunction with the previous questions a final solution can be found based off of the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Assumption 1
	\item Assumption 2
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Finance}
costs for installation
10 year projection
compare to tariff feedback/consumption reduction

\subsubsection{To Be Completed}
\paragraph{}
Notes:
\newline
Calculate losses from AC
Calculate losses from DC
Compare to standards for buildings and max losses (does this apply to DC?)
